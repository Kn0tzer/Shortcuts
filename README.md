# iLog/Lockdown Mode
iLog is a tool that tracks all activity on your device and logs it in a note.<br>
Lockdown mode is a way to prevent apps from being opened or closed and keep your device safe even if someone knows your password. If they don't have your password, you can also lock them out of the camera and control center that are always available on your lockscreen. Works best when remotely triggered, but can also be used as a preventitive measure.<br>
iLog is never being released due to it's complexity. Lockdown can in theory be released, but would need a major overhaul to do so. If anyone is interested, make a GitHub issue or contact me.<br>

# Live Wallpaper
Posts: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/shortcuts/comments/1ccaubc/working_live_wallpaper_coming_soon_not_a_shitpost">Announcement</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/shortcuts/comments/1cl5if3/unfinished_live_wallpaper_encouraging_others_to">Discontinuation</a><br>
Best on iOS 16 or earlier. Needs testing on iOS 18+<br>
Update: It wasn't patched in iOS 17 as I thought, instead Apple made iOS so incredibly slow it seemed like it was rate limited. For now on iOS 16+ I wouldn't recommend using this unless you're willing to deal with constant lag and occasional full device crashes. This project will not get any future support.<br>
